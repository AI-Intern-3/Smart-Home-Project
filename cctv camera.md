Designing a system to control electric bulbs, collect data from CCTV cameras, store that data in a database, and use AI models for analysis and predictions involves several steps. Below is a comprehensive outline of how you can implement this system, focusing on the components, architecture, and AI models required.

1. System Overview

The system will consist of:

Electric Bulb Control: Ability to turn the bulb on/off remotely.

Data Collection: Use of CCTV cameras to collect video and image data.

Data Storage: Storing collected data in a database.

AI Models: Analyzing the collected data to predict bulb lifespan and estimate electricity bills.


2. Components Required

Hardware

Microcontroller: (e.g., Raspberry Pi or Arduino) for controlling the electric bulb.

CCTV Camera: For capturing images and video data.

Relay Module: To control the electric bulb (turning it on/off).

Power Supply: For the microcontroller and camera.


Software

Programming Languages: Python for controlling hardware and data analysis.

Database: SQLite or MySQL for storing images, videos, and metadata.

AI/ML Libraries: TensorFlow or PyTorch for model development.

Web Framework: Flask or Django for creating a web interface.


3. System Architecture

The system architecture can be divided into the following layers:

1. Hardware Layer: Microcontroller, relay module, and CCTV camera.


2. Data Collection Layer: Capturing video and images from the CCTV camera.


3. Data Storage Layer: Storing images, videos, and control data in the database.


4. Analysis Layer: AI models for predicting bulb lifespan and analyzing energy consumption.


5. User Interface Layer: A web interface for controlling the bulb and visualizing data.



4. Implementation Steps

Step 1: Control Electric Bulb

Microcontroller Setup:

Connect the relay module to the microcontroller.

Use a GPIO pin to control the relay.


Control Logic: Write a Python script that listens for HTTP requests to turn the bulb on or off.


import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

# Setup
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
relay_pin = 17  # GPIO pin for relay
GPIO.setup(relay_pin, GPIO.OUT)

@app.route('/bulb/<action>', methods=['GET'])
def control_bulb(action):
    if action == 'on':
        GPIO.output(relay_pin, GPIO.HIGH)
        return "Bulb turned ON"
    elif action == 'off':
        GPIO.output(relay_pin, GPIO.LOW)
        return "Bulb turned OFF"
    else:
        return "Invalid action"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)

Step 2: Collect Data from CCTV

CCTV Setup:

Connect the CCTV camera to the network and ensure it has an accessible IP address.


Data Capture: Use OpenCV to capture frames from the camera and save them to the local storage.


import cv2
import time

camera_ip = 'http://<camera_ip>/video'
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(camera_ip)

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if ret:
        timestamp = time.strftime("%Y%m%d-%H%M%S")
        cv2.imwrite(f'images/frame_{timestamp}.jpg', frame)  # Save image
        # Optionally save video frames or stream
    time.sleep(60)  # Capture every minute

Step 3: Store Data in Database

Database Setup:

Create a database schema to store image paths, timestamps, and power consumption data.



CREATE TABLE bulb_control (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    action VARCHAR(10),
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE image_data (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    image_path VARCHAR(255),
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

Data Insertion: Write a function to insert data into the database when actions are taken or images are captured.


import mysql.connector

def insert_control_data(action):
    db = mysql.connector.connect(
        host="localhost",
        user="yourusername",
        password="yourpassword",
        database="yourdatabase"
    )
    cursor = db.cursor()
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO bulb_control (action) VALUES (%s)", (action,))
    db.commit()
    cursor.close()
    db.close()

Step 4: Analyze Data with AI Models

Data Preparation: Prepare the collected data for analysis, including cleaning and feature engineering.

Model Training:

Lifespan Prediction: Use regression models to predict the lifespan of the bulbs based on usage data and environmental factors.

Bill Prediction: Use time series forecasting to predict future electricity bills based on historical consumption data.



from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
import pandas as pd

# Load your data
data = pd.read_csv('power_consumption_data.csv')
X = data[['usage_hours', 'bulb_type']]  # Features
y = data['lifespan']  # Target variable

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = RandomForestRegressor()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

Step 5: Visualization and User Interface

Web Interface: Create a web interface to control the bulb and visualize data using Flask and a JavaScript library (like Chart.js).


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Smart Bulb Control</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Control Electric Bulb</h1>
    <button onclick="fetch('/bulb/on')">Turn ON</button>
    <button onclick="fetch('/bulb/off')">Turn OFF</button>
    <h2>Image Data</h2>
    <img src="images/frame_latest.jpg" alt="Latest Frame">
</body>
</html>
