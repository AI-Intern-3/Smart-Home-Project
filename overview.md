Use MAX30102 to monitor heart rate.

DHT11 for temperature and humidity.

Accelerometer for motion detection (fall or abnormal movements).



from machine import Pin, I2C

import dht

# Initialize sensor
dht_sensor = dht.DHT11(Pin(14))
hr_sensor = MAX30102.MAX30102(i2c=I2C(0))

# Read sensor data
temperature = dht_sensor.temperature()
humidity = dht_sensor.humidity()
heart_rate = hr_sensor.get_heart_rate()

4.2 Microcontroller Processing

ESP32/ESP8266 will gather data from sensors and run AI/ML models for predictions.

WiFi or Ethernet to upload data to the cloud database.

GSM Module to send SMS alerts or SOS signals if WiFi is unavailable.


import network

# Connect to WiFi
wifi = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
wifi.active(True)
wifi.connect('your_ssid', 'your_password')

# Check if connected
if wifi.isconnected():
    print("Connected to WiFi!")

4.4 GSM Module for Location Tracking and Alerts

SIM800/900 modules send location data and receive GPS signals for tracking family members or vehicles.


import serial

# Initialize GSM Module
gsm = serial.Serial("/dev/ttyS0", baudrate=9600, timeout=1)

def send_sms(message):
    gsm.write(b'AT+CMGF=1\r')  # Set SMS mode to text
    gsm.write(b'AT+CMGS="+1234567890"\r')  # Replace with recipient number
    gsm.write(message.encode())
    gsm.write(b'\x1A')  # End SMS with Ctrl+Z

4.5 Cloud Integration

Use APIs to upload sensor data to cloud storage or a database, e.g., using Firebase or MySQL for storing and analyzing the data.

import urequests

url = "https://your-database-url.com/upload"
data = {"heart_rate": heart_rate, "temperature": temperature}

response = urequests.post(url, json=data)

5. AI/ML Integration

5.1 Predictive Modeling

Use health data to predict emergencies (e.g., abnormal heart rate or temperature).

Use current and voltage data to predict power consumption patterns and equipment lifespan.


Example: Decision Tree for classification of health emergencies.

from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# Train model (using pre-collected health data)
X = [[75, 98.6], [120, 102], [65, 97]]  # Heart rate, temperature
y = [0, 1, 0]  # 1: Emergency, 0: Normal

model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict based on new data
emergency = model.predict([[130, 103]])

5.2 Deploying AI Models

Use TensorFlow Lite to deploy pre-trained models onto the microcontroller.

Monitor sensor data in real-time and trigger alarms if the prediction model indicates an emergency.
